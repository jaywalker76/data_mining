    "We can see that there's been a lot of stuff done on network/link analysis. A fairly good overview is done with [Mining Massive Datasets](http://mmds.org/). Chapter 10: [Mining Social Network Graphs](http://infolab.stanford.edu/~ullman/mmds/ch10.pdf) is of particular interest. Chapter 5: [Link Analysis](http://infolab.stanford.edu/~ullman/mmds/ch5.pdf) is also interesting. Also of interest but less specific to Link Analysis is [Ch. 6: Frequent Itemset Mining](http://mmds.org/mmds/v2.1/ch06-assocrules.pdf)"
