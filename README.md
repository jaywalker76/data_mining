Data Mining
===========

Working through examples provided in [Mining Massive Datasets](http://www.mmds.org/) book. Please note that the problems completed here are not
the same as those provided for the [Mining Massive Datasets MOOC](https://www.coursera.org/course/mmds). My goal is to learn more about locally
sensitive hashing and entity resolution.
